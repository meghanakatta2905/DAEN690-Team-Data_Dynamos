# PRODUCT-LABEL-RECOGNIZATION-ON-FDA-PROJECT
This project works on the FDA 
The FDA Product Label Recognition project aims to use advanced algorithms based on machine learning to automate and improve the process of creating FDA product codes. By applying natural language and image processing tools, the project improves efficiency, decreases the amount of human labor required, and increases the accuracy with which FDA inspectors assign product codes.
